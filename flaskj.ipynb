    "The GET and POST methods are two common HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods used for communication\n",

    "GET Method:\n",
    "The GET method is primarily used to retrieve data from a server. When a client sends a GET request,\n",
    "it asks the server to send back a specific resource identified by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator).\n",
    "The parameters for the request are typically included in the URL itself as query parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "POST Method:\n",
    "The POST method is used to submit data to be processed by a server.\n",
    "Unlike GET, the data is not appended to the URL but is included in the body of the HTTP request.\n",
    "POST requests are commonly used when creating, updating,\n",
    "or deleting resources on a server. "
